When you think about desktop apps today, Electron often comes to mind. It's the go-to framework for developers looking to build cross-platform apps with modern UIs using web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. But here’s the thing: is this reliance on Electron always a good idea? Let’s unpack this by looking at performance and usability—and how it all relates to the kind of experience you’re trying to deliver.

## The Case for Electron

Electron has one undeniable advantage: it lowers the barrier to entry. If you already know how to build web apps, you can pivot to desktop apps without learning a completely new stack. Popular tools like VS Code, Discord, and Slack use Electron, showcasing how it’s possible to build polished, feature-rich apps. For developers, this is a huge win—you get a single codebase that runs across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The framework also shines when it comes to UI design. Electron apps can incorporate the same modern, responsive interfaces that web apps are known for. With frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, developers can create slick designs and implement features quickly. Add in the massive JavaScript ecosystem, and your development process becomes both fast and flexible.

## The Downsides: Performance and Resource Usage

But there’s a flip side—Electron’s heavy reliance on Chromium, the engine that powers browsers like Chrome, comes at a cost. Running what is essentially a browser for every Electron app you open means:

- **High memory usage:** It’s not uncommon for Electron apps to consume hundreds of megabytes (or even gigabytes) of RAM.
- **High CPU usage:** For something as lightweight as a terminal or a to-do list app, the processing power Electron demands can feel excessive.
- **Battery drain:** On laptops, especially, running multiple Electron apps can significantly impact battery life.

When compared to native apps written in languages like C++, Rust, or even Python with efficient libraries, Electron apps often feel bloated. Take terminals, for example. Alacritty, written in Rust, is a blazing-fast GPU-accelerated terminal. Compare that to Electron-based terminals like Hyper or Tabby, and you’ll immediately notice a performance gap—Hyper might look modern, but its performance pales in comparison.

## Is Electron a "Hack"?

Some argue that Electron is a kind of hack—a quick-and-dirty solution to a complex problem. By wrapping web technology in a desktop shell, you get cross-platform compatibility, but at the cost of efficiency.

Does this mean Electron should be avoided entirely? Not necessarily. For apps where a modern UI is a priority and performance isn’t mission-critical, Electron makes sense. But for something like a terminal, which needs to be fast, efficient, and lightweight, it’s hard to justify using Electron.

## Can’t We Have Both Modern UI and Performance?

Here’s the kicker: modern UI and high performance don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Frameworks like Tauri and Rust’s Dioxus offer a middle ground. Tauri, for example, uses web technologies for the UI but relies on a lightweight backend written in Rust, leading to much smaller apps with significantly better performance. It’s not as mature as Electron, but it’s an exciting alternative.

## A Hypocritical Take?

Now, I’ll admit—I’m a user of JavaScript and TypeScript. I love building with them, and I get why so many developers gravitate toward Electron. But we’ve got to be real here: just because something is easy doesn’t mean it’s always the best choice. Over-relying on Electron for every desktop app—especially ones where performance matters—can lead to bloated software that alienates users.

## Final Thoughts

Electron isn’t inherently bad. It’s a tool, and like any tool, it has its place. If you’re building an app where cross-platform support and UI flexibility are more important than raw performance, Electron can be a fantastic choice. But for apps where efficiency is critical—like a terminal or any app that’s meant to run smoothly on lower-end hardware—it might be time to explore alternatives.

Ultimately, the best apps strike a balance. As developers, we should aim for software that feels modern and responsive without overtaxing the user’s machine. And maybe, just maybe, that means it’s time to look beyond Electron for certain use cases.
