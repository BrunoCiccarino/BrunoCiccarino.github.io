# PowerShell Zero to Hero for DevOps

Welcome to the PowerShell journey! Whether you’re new to scripting or already a DevOps pro looking to add another tool to your arsenal, PowerShell has you covered. From automating tedious tasks to building robust workflows, this guide will take you from zero to hero. And no, we’re not talking about dry documentation here—this is real talk for real-world use cases.

## Why PowerShell?
Let’s start with the big question: why should you care about PowerShell?

- **Cross-Platform Power:** PowerShell isn’t just for Windows anymore. It’s fully cross-platform, running on macOS and Linux too. No more excuses!
- **Built-In Automation:** With cmdlets designed for managing everything from files to Active Directory, PowerShell makes automation straightforward.
- **Scripting Made Easy:** Its scripting language is both powerful and accessible, making it a perfect choice for beginners and advanced users alike.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with tools like Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes, making it a dream for DevOps workflows.

Ready to dive in? Let’s go.

## PowerShell Basics: Speaking the Language
First up, we’ve got to cover some basics. Think of PowerShell’s syntax as its vocabulary. Here are some key concepts:

### Cmdlets: The Building Blocks
Cmdlets (pronounced “command-lets”) are PowerShell’s bread and butter. They follow the `Verb-Noun` naming convention, making them intuitive to use. For example:

```powershell
Get-Process        # Retrieves a list of running processes
Start-Service      # Starts a Windows service
Stop-VM            # Stops a virtual machine
```

Each cmdlet has a specific purpose, and their discoverability is fantastic. You can use `Get-Command` to list available cmdlets:

```powershell
Get-Command
```

Want to learn more about a specific cmdlet? Use `Get-Help`:

```powershell
Get-Help Get-Process
```

### Variables
PowerShell variables are declared with a `$` prefix:

```powershell
$Name = "PowerShell"
$Number = 42
$Array = @("DevOps", "Automation", "Scripts")
```

Access variables like this:

```powershell
Write-Output $Name  # Outputs: PowerShell
```

### Piping and Filtering
One of PowerShell’s superpowers is its ability to pass data between cmdlets using pipes (`|`):

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 100}
```

This example filters processes with a CPU usage greater than 100.

### Loops and Conditionals
Want to repeat tasks or add some logic? PowerShell’s got you:

```powershell
# For loop
for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
    Write-Output "Iteration $i"
}

# If-Else
if ($true) {
    Write-Output "This is true"
} else {
    Write-Output "This is false"
}
```

### Writing Scripts: Automation Galore
Now that you’re warmed up, let’s dive into scripting—PowerShell’s real superpower. A script is just a .ps1 file containing PowerShell commands. It’s like a to-do list for your computer.

#### Creating Your First Script
Save this to a file named `HelloWorld.ps1`:

```powershell
# A simple script
Write-Output "Hello, PowerShell world!"
```

Run it by navigating to the script’s directory and typing:

```powershell
..\uHelloWorld.ps1
```

#### Automating Tasks with Parameters
Scripts can accept parameters to make them more flexible. Here’s an example:

```powershell
param(
    [string]$Name = "User",
    [int]$Age = 30
)

Write-Output "Hello, $Name! You are $Age years old."
```

Run it like this:

```powershell
..\uYourScript.ps1 -Name "Alice" -Age 25
```

#### Scheduled Scripts
Want your script to run at a specific time? Use Task Scheduler or `Register-ScheduledTask`. Here’s how:

```powershell
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "PowerShell.exe" -Argument "-File C:\Scripts\YourScript.ps1"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 9:00AM
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -TaskName "DailyScriptRun"
```

#### Modularizing Your Scripts
Break your scripts into functions for better reusability. For example:

```powershell
function Get-Greeting {
    param([string]$Name)
    return "Hello, $Name!"
}

Write-Output (Get-Greeting -Name "DevOps Pro")
```

#### Error Handling
Scripts can fail, but you can handle errors gracefully using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks:

```powershell
try {
    Get-Item -Path "C:\NonExistentFile.txt"
} catch {
    Write-Output "Oops! Something went wrong: $_"
} finally {
    Write-Output "Script completed."
}
```

### Debugging and Logging
While writing scripts, you’ll want to debug and log what’s happening:

- Use `Write-Debug` for debugging messages. Enable debugging with `-Debug`.
- Log output to a file using `Out-File` or `Start-Transcript`:

```powershell
Write-Debug "This is a debug message."
Write-Output "Logging this to a file." | Out-File -FilePath "C:\Logs\log.txt"

Start-Transcript -Path "C:\Logs\transcript.txt"
# Your commands here
Stop-Transcript
```

### Real-World Example: Deploying a Web App
Here’s a mini-project to put everything together. Let’s automate a web app deployment:

```powershell
# Parameters
param(
    [string]$AppPath = "C:\WebApp",
    [string]$BackupPath = "C:\Backup"
)

# Backup existing app
if (Test-Path $AppPath) {
    Copy-Item -Path $AppPath -Destination $BackupPath -Recurse
    Write-Output "Backup completed."
} else {
    Write-Output "App path not found."
}

# Deploy new version
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $AppPath -Force
Copy-Item -Path "C:\NewAppVersion\*" -Destination $AppPath -Recurse
Write-Output "Deployment completed."
```

## Moving Around in PowerShell
PowerShell isn’t just a scripting language—it’s also a shell. Mastering navigation will make your life easier:

### Navigation Basics

- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls` or `Get-ChildItem`: List contents
- `pwd`: Show current directory

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourName
ls
pwd
```

### Working with Files
PowerShell simplifies file operations:

```powershell
New-Item -Path "C:\Temp\myfile.txt" -ItemType File
Set-Content -Path "C:\Temp\myfile.txt" -Value "Hello, PowerShell!"
Get-Content -Path "C:\Temp\myfile.txt"
```

### Aliases
PowerShell provides aliases for common commands:

```powershell
dir # Alias for Get-ChildItem
```

Use `Get-Alias` to list all aliases.

## Commands That Level Up Your Workflow
Here are some essential commands that every DevOps pro should know:

### Automation and Scripting Magic

Sometimes, you just need to automate the heck out of a task. Here’s how PowerShell can help:

- `Start-Job` to run scripts in the background. Imagine kicking off a task and moving on without waiting.
- `Invoke-WebRequest` for hitting APIs or downloading files. It’s your go-to for web-related tasks.
- `Measure-Command` to time how long your script runs. Perfect for optimizing your workflow.

```powershell
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-Process > C:\Temp\processes.txt }
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://example.com/file.zip" -OutFile "C:\Temp\file.zip"
Measure-Command { Get-ChildItem -Recurse }
```

### System Insights

Ever feel like you’re Sherlock Holmes, trying to find out what’s happening on your machine? These commands are your magnifying glass:

- `Get-Process` to see what’s running. Spot the culprits eating your RAM.
- `Get-Service` to list all the services. Is something not running that should be?
- `Test-Connection` to ping a host. Because connectivity issues are always a thing.

```powershell
Get-Process
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq "Running" }
Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com
```

### File and Directory Wizardry

You’re dealing with files all day long. Here’s how PowerShell makes it painless:

- `Compress-Archive` to zip files. Because who wants to click around for that?
- `Expand-Archive` to unzip. Obvious follow-up, right?
- `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`, and `Remove-Item` to handle your file management like a pro.

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path "C:\Logs" -DestinationPath "C:\Logs.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "C:\Logs.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\Logs"
Copy-Item -Path "C:\Temp\file.txt" -Destination "C:\Backup"
```

### Network Tricks

Need to troubleshoot or manage network stuff? PowerShell’s got your back:

- `Get-NetAdapter` to check network interfaces. Why is Wi-Fi acting weird?
- `New-NetIPAddress` to assign an IP address. Manually setting up your environment? No problem.
- `Test-NetConnection` for detailed connectivity tests.

```powershell
Get-NetAdapter
New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.1.100 -PrefixLength 24 -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet"
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName github.com
```

### Registry Kung Fu

Messing with the registry? Do it safely with PowerShell:

- `Get-ItemProperty` to read registry keys.
- `Set-ItemProperty` to modify them. But hey, be careful here!
- `Remove-ItemProperty` if you’re cleaning up old entries.

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\YourApp"
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\YourApp" -Name "Setting" -Value "Enabled"
Remove-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\YourApp" -Name "OldSetting"
```

### Handy One-Liners

Let’s finish with some quick one-liners you can memorize:

- Count files in a directory:

```powershell
(Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Logs" -Recurse | Measure-Object).Count
```

- Find large files:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\" -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1GB }
```

- Check disk space:

```powershell
Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem
```

## Frameworks to Know
PowerShell has several useful frameworks and modules that extend its functionality:

- **Pester**: Unit testing for your scripts.
- **PSReadLine**: Enhances your command-line editing experience.
- **Azure PowerShell**: Manage Azure resources directly from PowerShell.

Install frameworks using `Install-Module`:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser
```
