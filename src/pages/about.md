I'm a Brazilian full stack dev, I'm a lua language enthusiast, addicted to neovim/vim and its entire ecosystem, proficient in c, javascript and lua. I like writing about programming and I'm quite curious! This is the extent of my brain, so I'm going to post here about everything I've been learning.
